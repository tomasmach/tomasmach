# 👨‍💻 Tomáš Mach

Hello! I'm Tomáš, a Software Developer at [Prusa Research a.s.](https://www.prusa3d.com/) and a freelance programmer. I specialize in **Python** development, with a strong focus on **Django**, **Asyncio**, and **MQTT** for efficient and scalable communication systems.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 **Languages & Tech:** Python, Django, Asyncio, C, and a beginner in JavaScript.
- 🌐 **Focus:** Currently working mainly on backend, but learning to master fullstack.
- 🎯 **Goal:** Improve my skills every day and develop my own project [QuietPage](https://github.com/tomasmach/quietpage) (starting 26.11.2024!).
- 🏃‍♂️ **Fun Fact:** I lost 50 kg in the past year! Now, I'm thinking about tackling a half-marathon (even though I don't actually enjoy running 😅).

## 🌱 Personal Goals

I'm driven by a passion for coding and problem-solving. I never want to fall into the trap of endless meetings – I love programming and can't picture myself doing anything else. Even though I'm still a junior, I'm fearless about diving into unknown territories and learning as I go.
